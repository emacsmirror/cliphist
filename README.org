Read data from clipboard managers at Linux and macOS,
- [[http://parcellite.sourceforge.net/][Parcellite]] on Linux
- [[http://clipit.sourceforge.net/][ClipIt]] on Linux
- [[https://github.com/erebe/greenclip]] on Linux
- [[https://github.com/TermiT/Flycut][Flycut]] on macOS
* Install
The easiest way is install from [[http://melpa.org][melpa]] using package manager.

If you install from source code, please place cliphist.el somewhere (say =~/.emacs/lisp=), and insert below code into =~/.emacs=:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/lisp/")
(require 'cliphist)
#+end_src

* Usage
Make sure the clipboard manager is running.

If you use Flycut on macOS, set up "Preferences > General > Clippings" so its value is "Save After each clip".
- =M-x cliphist-paste-item= to paste item from history. =C-u M-x cliphist-paste-item= rectangle paste item
- =M-x cliphist-select-item= to select item

* Tips (OPTIONAL)
** Customize the behavior of =cliphist-select-item=
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-select-item-callback
      (lambda (num str) (cliphist-copy-to-clipboard str)))
#+end_src
** Copy selected clipboard item into =kill-ring=
If `cliphist-cc-kill-ring` is true, the selected/pasted string will be inserted into kill-ring.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-cc-kill-ring t)
#+end_src
** Detect clipboard manager
You can tweak =cliphist-linux-clipboard-managers= to tell cliphist how to detect clipboard manager,
#+begin_src elisp
(setq cliphist-linux-clipboard-managers '("greenclip" "clipit" "parcellite"))
#+end_src
** Set up greenclip
Set =cliphist-greenclip-program= if greenclip program is not added into =load-path= and you use greenclip.
